High performance laser engraving firmware

Adapt Klipper to laser engraving applications, with various optimizations, including:
- Combined movement of traditional X/Y gantry, and two-axis galvo
- Rapid PWM switching for laser engraving applications
- Optimization of consecutive scanning moves for raster engrave. Up to 4000mm/s with 0.05mm line spacing achieved (Raspberry Pi 4B)

Limitations and Challenges:
